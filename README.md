# bashMenu
This is a Bash Menu I created for Computer and Communication Systems Lab

Brief
Write a shell script program to provide the following facilities to a user in the form of a menu:

  i. Allow the user to use an editor e.g. nano (which can be called from the command line
using nano filename) to write a poem.

  ii. Run a word count on your poem using wc

  iii. Display the output to the screen and display a page at a time using more or less (ask the user
which one they want to use).

  iv. Sort the output using the UNIX sort command and put the results into a file, then display the
output of the sorted file using cat or more. (ask the user which one they want to use)

  v. Exit
